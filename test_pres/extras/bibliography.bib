abstract={The basicity of highly protonated cytochrome c (cyt c) and myoglobin (myo) ions were investigated using tandem mass spectrometry, ion–molecule reactions (IMRs), and theoretical calculations as a function of charge state. Surprisingly, highly charged protein ions (HCPI) can readily protonate non-polar molecules and inert gases, including Ar, O2, and N2 in thermal IMRs. The most HCPIs that can be observed are over 130 kJ mol−1 less basic than the least basic neutral organic molecules known (tetrafluoromethane and methane). Based on theoretical calculations, it is predicted that protonated cyt c and myo ions should spontaneously lose a proton to vacuum for charge states in which every third residue is protonated. In this study, HCPIs are formed where every fourth residue on average is protonated. These results indicate that protein ions in higher charge states can be formed using a low-pressure ion source to reduce proton-transfer reactions between protein ions and gases from the atmosphere.},

title={Structural and functional insights into S -thiolation of human serum albumins},
journal={Scientific Reports},
volume={8},

abstract={Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant serum protein, contributing to the maintenance of redox balance in the extracellular fluids. One single free cysteine residue at position 34 is believed to be a target of oxidation. However, the molecular details and functions of oxidized HSAs remain obscure. Here we analyzed serum samples from normal subjects and hyperlipidemia patients and observed an enhanced S-thiolation of HSA in the hyperlipidemia patients as compared to the control individuals. Both cysteine and homocysteine were identified as the low molecular weight thiols bound to the HSAs. Intriguingly, S-thiolations were observed not only at Cys34, but also at multiple cysteine residues in the disulfide bonds of HSA. When the serum albumins from genetically modified mice that exhibit high levels of total homocysteine in serum were analyzed, we observed an enhanced S-homocysteinylation at multiple cysteine residues. In addition, the cysteine residues in the disulfide bonds were also thiolated in recombinant HSA that had been treated with the disulfide molecules. These findings and the result that S-homocysteinylation mediated increased surface hydrophobicity and ligand binding activity of HSA offer new insights into structural and functional alternation of serum albumins via S-thiolation.},

title={What Protein Charging (and Supercharging) Reveal about the Mechanism of Electrospray Ionization},
journal={Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry},
volume={25},
number={10},
pages={1675-1693},
abstract={Understanding the charging mechanism of electrospray ionization is central to overcoming shortcomings such as ion suppression or limited dynamic range and explaining phenomena such as supercharging. Towards that end, we explore what accumulated observations reveal about the mechanism of electrospray. We introduce the idea of an intermediate region for electrospray ionization (and other ionization methods) to account for the facts that solution charge state distributions (CSDs) do not correlate to those observed by ESI– MS (the latter bear more charge) and that gas phase reactions can reduce, but not increase the extent of charging. This region incorporates properties, e.g., basicities, intermediate between solution and gas phase. Assuming that droplet species polarize within the high electric field leads to equations describing ion emission resembling those from the equilibrium partitioning model. The equations predict many trends successfully, including CSD shifts to higher m/z for concentrated analytes and shifts to lower m/z for sprays employing smaller emitter opening diameters. From this view, a single mechanism can be formulated to explain how reagents that promote analyte charging (“supercharging”) such as m–NBA, sulfolane, and 3–nitrobenzonitrile increase analyte charge from “denaturing” and “native” solvent systems. It is suggested that additives’ Brønsted basicities are inversely correlated to their ability to shift CSDs to lower m/z in positive ESI, as are Brønsted acidities for negative ESI. Because supercharging agents reduce an analyte's solution ionization, excess spray charge is bestowed on evaporating ions carryingfewer opposing charges. Brønsted basicity (or acidity) determines how much ESI charge is lost to the agent (unavailable to evaporating analyte).},

title={Chain Ejection Model for Electrospray Ionization of Unfolded Proteins: Evidence from Atomistic Simulations and Ion Mobility Spectrometry},
journal={Analytical Chemistry},
volume={90},
number={16},
pages={10069-10077},
abstract={The ion evaporation model (IEM) and the charged residue model (CRM) represent cornerstones of any discussion related to the mechanism of electrospray ionization (ESI). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have confirmed that small ions such as Na+ are ejected from the surface of aqueous ESI droplets (IEM), while folded proteins in native ESI are released by water evaporation to dryness (CRM). ESI of unfolded proteins yields [M + zH]z+ ions that are much more highly charged than their folded counterparts. A chain ejection model (CEM) has been proposed to account for the protein ESI behavior under such non-native conditions (Konermann, L., et al. Anal. Chem. 2013, 85, 2–9). The CEM envisions that unfolded proteins are driven to the droplet surface by hydrophobic and electrostatic factors, followed by gradual ejection via intermediates where droplets carry extended protein tails. Thus far, it has not been possible to support the CEM through MD simulations using realistic protein models and atomistic force fields. Such endeavors require much larger droplets than in previous MD studies. Also, the incorporation of CEM-related H+ migration is difficult. This work overcomes these challenges in MD simulations on unfolded apo-myoglobin (aMb) in droplets with a 5.5 nm radius (∼22500 water molecules). We focused on solutions at pH ∼4 where the aMb solution charge coincides with the charge on some of the electrosprayed ions (22+ to 27+), such that H+ migration could be neglected. Na+ ions were added to ensure a droplet charge close to the Rayleigh limit. We found that 16 of 17 MD runs on various protonation patterns produced [M + zH]z+ ions via chain ejection. The predicted stretched-out aMb conformations were consistent with experimental collision cross sections. These results support the view that unfolded proteins follow the CEM. Overall, the IEM/CRM/CEM triad can account for a wide range of ESI scenarios involving various types of analytes.},

pages={8244-8250},
abstract={Biologists' preeminent toolbox for separating, analyzing, and visualizing proteins is SDS-PAGE, yet recovering the proteins embedded in these polyacrylamide media as intact species is a long-standing challenge for mass spectrometry. In conventional workflows, protein mixtures from crude biological samples are electrophoretically separated at high-resolution within N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide cross-linked polyacrylamide gels to reduce sample complexity and facilitate sensitive characterization. However, low protein recoveries, especially for high molecular weight proteins, often hinder characterization by mass spectrometry. We describe a workflow for top-down/bottom-up mass spectrometric analyses of proteins in polyacrylamide slab gels using dissolvable, bis-acryloylcystamine-cross-linked polyacrylamide, enabling high-resolution protein separations while recovering intact proteins over a broad size range efficiently. The inferior electrophoretic resolution long associated with reducible gels has been overcome, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE of crude tissue extracts. This workflow elutes intact proteins efficiently, supporting MS and MS/MS from proteins resolved on biologists' preferred separation platform.},

  volume = {19},

  abstract = {Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is a critically important technique for the determination of small molecules, but its application for this purpose is complicated by its selectivity. For positive ion ESI-MS analysis of basic analytes, several investigators have pointed to the importance of analyte basicity as a source of selectivity. Currently, however, it is not known whether basicity in the gas phase or in solution is ultimately most important in determining responsiveness. The objective of these studies was to investigate the relative importance of basicity in solution and in the gas phase as factors that predict selectivity in positive ion ESI-MS analysis. ESI-MS response was compared for a diverse series of protonatable analytes in two different solvents, neat methanol and methanol with 0.5\% acetic acid. A correlation was observed between analyte pKb and electrospray response. However, the response for the analytes with very high pKb values was significantly higher than would be expected based on concentration of the protonated form or the analyte in solution, and this higher response did not appear to result from gas-phase proton transfer reactions. Although all of the analytes investigated had higher gas-phase basicities than the solvent, their relative responses were not dictated by gas-phase basicity. Higher response was observed for all of the analytes studied in acidified methanol compared with neat methanol, and this higher response was most pronounced for weakly basic analytes. These findings support the use of analyte pKb for rational method development in ESI-MS analysis of small molecules. {"}},
