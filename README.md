HTML Presentations

This page is for hosting [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
and other HTML-based presentations by David Butcher.

[Root GitHub page](https://davidsbutcher.github.io/html_presentations/)

[Xaringan test
presentation](https://davidsbutcher.github.io/html_presentations/test_pres/)

If a Xaringan presentation needs to be portable, the entire presentation
directory must be cloned to a local directory from GitHub, not just the
HTML file\!
