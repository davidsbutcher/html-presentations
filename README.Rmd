This page is for hosting [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and other HTML-based presentations by David Butcher.

[Root GitHub page](https://davidsbutcher.github.io/xaringan_presentations/)

[Xaringan test presentation](https://davidsbutcher.github.io/xaringan_presentations/test)

If a Xaringan presentation needs to be portable, the entire presentation directory must be cloned to a local directory from GitHub, not just the HTML file!
